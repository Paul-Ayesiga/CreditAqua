## 3. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


### 3.1 Development Methodology: Agile (Lightweight, Kanban/Scrum Hybrid)

#### 3.1.1 Why Agile?
- Rapid requirement changes in microfinance sector
- Need for frequent stakeholder feedback
- Iterative development for complex IoT integration
- Risk mitigation through incremental delivery


#### 3.1.2 Team & Workflow
- **Team Size**: 2 developers
- **Sprint/Iteration Duration**: 2 weeks (flexible, based on workload)
- **Release Cycle**: Monthly production releases
- **Daily Standups**: Brief async check-ins (chat or call)
- **Task Tracking**: Kanban board (GitHub Projects, Trello, or Notion)
- **Code Reviews**: Peer review for all pull requests
- **Communication**: Direct, fast feedback, minimal meetings


### 3.2 SDLC Phases (Tailored for Small Laravel Livewire Web App Team)


#### Phase 1: Planning & Analysis (1 week)
- Quick requirements gathering (stakeholder calls, chat, docs)
- Define MVP features and priorities
- Identify integration points and risks
- Create a simple project board for tasks

**Deliverables:**
- Short requirements doc (can be a shared note or markdown file)
- Task board with prioritized features


#### Phase 2: System Design (1 week)
- Sketch high-level architecture (Laravel Livewire, Blade, DB)
- Create simple UI wireframes (Figma, Excalidraw, or paper)
- Define database schema (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, or migration stubs)
- Document API endpoints if needed

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture sketch or diagram
- Wireframes/screenshots
- Migration files or schema doc


#### Phase 3: Implementation (Ongoing, Iterative)
- Work in small, testable increments (feature branches)
- Use Laravel Livewire for interactive UI
- Write and run tests (Pest/PHPUnit) for new features
- Peer review all code before merging
- Demo new features to stakeholders as soon as possible

**Deliverables per Iteration:**
- Working software increment
- Passing tests
- Code reviewed and merged


#### Phase 4: Integration (As Needed)
- Integrate with external APIs/services as features require
- Document integration points and test thoroughly


#### Phase 5: Testing (Continuous)
- Write tests for all new features (unit, feature, browser)
- Run tests locally and in CI before merging
- Manual testing for major features
- Stakeholder review before release

**Deliverables:**
- Passing test suite
- Stakeholder sign-off for releases


#### Phase 6: Deployment & Go-Live
- Deploy using simple CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Forge, or manual)
- Migrate database and verify production
- Monitor errors and performance
- Provide user support and documentation

**Deliverables:**
- Deployed, working application
- User guide or onboarding doc


#### Phase 7: Post-Implementation Support (Ongoing)
- Monitor app, fix bugs, and improve features as needed
- Regular check-ins with stakeholders


### 3.3 Quality Assurance Strategy (Small Team)


#### 3.3.1 Code Quality Standards
- Peer review for all code (pull requests)
- Follow Laravel and PHP best practices
- Use inline documentation and clear commit messages
- Use Git with feature branches


#### 3.3.2 Testing Strategy
- Write and run tests for all new features (Pest/PHPUnit)
- Use browser tests for critical flows (Laravel Dusk if needed)
- Manual testing for UI/UX and integrations
- Use CI to run tests on every push/PR


#### 3.3.3 DevOps and CI/CD Pipeline
- Use GitHub Actions or similar for CI (run tests, lint)
- Simple deployment scripts or Laravel Forge
- Automate database migrations on deploy

### 3.4 Risk Management

#### 3.4.1 Technical Risks
**Risk**: Integration complexity with existing microfinance system
- **Mitigation**: Early proof-of-concept, dedicated integration team

**Risk**: IoT device connectivity issues in rural areas
- **Mitigation**: Offline capability, data synchronization strategies

**Risk**: Payment gateway failures or limitations
- **Mitigation**: Multiple payment provider integrations, fallback options

#### 3.4.2 Business Risks
**Risk**: Regulatory changes affecting microfinance operations
- **Mitigation**: Regular compliance reviews, flexible system architecture

**Risk**: Customer adoption challenges
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive user training, gradual rollout strategy

**Risk**: Manufacturer relationship management
- **Mitigation**: Clear SLAs, multiple supplier agreements


### 3.5 Resource Planning

#### 3.5.1 Team Structure
**Core Team (2 people)**
- Full-stack Laravel/Livewire Developers (2)

**Part-time/Consulting (as needed)**
- UI/UX Designer (contract or freelance)
- Domain Expert (microfinance, consulting)


#### 3.5.2 Technology Stack
**Backend & Frontend**
- Laravel (PHP), Livewire, Blade
- Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- UI: Tailwind CSS

**Infrastructure**
- Shared hosting, VPS, or managed Laravel hosting (Forge, Ploi, etc.)
- GitHub Actions or simple CI/CD

**Integrations**
- Payment: Stripe, Flutterwave, or local providers
- Others as needed
